# Neural Network from Scratch with Animated Visualization

This repository contains a Python script that builds a simple neural network from scratch using NumPy and visualizes its decision boundary as it is trained on a synthetic dataset.

## Features

- **Neural Network Implementation**: A simple feedforward neural network with one hidden layer.
- **Training from Scratch**: Uses backpropagation and gradient descent to train the network.
- **Animated Visualization**: Uses Matplotlib to animate the decision boundary as the network is trained.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Installation

Clone this repository and navigate to the directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/neural-network-animation.git
cd neural-network-animation
```

Install the required packages:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib
```

## Usage

Run the script to see the neural network in action:

```bash
python neural_network_with_animation.py
```

An animated plot will appear showing the decision boundary as it changes during the training process.
